  <li><b>Interest in App Inventor </b></li>
  <p>I am interested in this app because I did it as my first app. It's very helpful to teach beginners what is the logical way to develop an app. 
    App Inventor allows users to create applications without needing to have advanced programming skills.
    It can be a powerful tool for beginners who want to learn how to code.</p>
  <li><b>Interest in introductory programming </b></li>
  <p> I do not have personal experiences. However, App Inventor has a user-friendly interface that can be easily understood by beginners, 
    which makes it an ideal platform for introducing programming concepts.</p>
  <li><b>Proposed summer project </b></li>
  <p> I am interested in the idea of creating a new dialog box for Project Properties. I propose to create a new dialog box for Project Properties in the designer view of the application. This will allow the user to easily access and modify project-wide properties such as the App Name and Theme without the need to navigate through the individual components.
</p>
  <li><b>Experience with the development tools</b></li>
  <p> I am familiar with the Java language. I can use it to develop applications. Also, I know the basic of GWT.</p>
  <li><b>Experience with teams, online developer communities and large code bases</b></li>
  <p> I did experience developing applications with a team but not online developer communities and large code bases.
    I am looking for this opportunity to join the big program. When I collaborate  with others, I am nice and do my best.
